    <h1>Heyyy my Valentine, Chaand! ❤️</h1>
    <p>Had to tell u something that took me a while to realize, but slowly, because of u, I found my way out of that dark phase. I was already moving on, but when I realized I actually felt something for u, everything just started feeling right.</p>
    <p>Honestly, seeing u think about someone else used to hurt me, but then that night—November 7th-8th—it changed everything. Never thought we'd be like this, but here we are. Our minds, our vibes, our way of seeing things—they were all different. But somehow, we made it work. Now, here we are, celebrating our first Valentine’s together.</p>
    <p>And trust me, this is just the beginning. I want 50+ more Valentine’s with you, each one better than the last. You and me, always.</p>
